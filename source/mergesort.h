//mergesort sorting algorithm implementation
//properties:
//time complexity: O(NlogN) there are logN merge and each merge requires N comparison
//space complexity: O(N) an extra array with the input size is needed
//stability: the algorithm is stable if the merge is implemented as stable
//time and space performance are independent from the input
